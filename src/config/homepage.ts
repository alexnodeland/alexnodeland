      "I've always had an innate interest in technology. I remember building my first \"guitar pedal\" when I was around 10 years old, it was a rudimentary talk box (literally held together with duct tape), but it worked! That first experience with creative technology sparked my interest.",
      "My subsequent deep dive into music technology lasted throughout my youth and university years, and ultimately lead me to the space of computational mathematics and distributed computing, specifically distributed-memory HPC. Also, having been exposed to startups at a very early age, joining one as my first job at 15 years old, I learned the importance of building scalable technical strategy, from processes to product. These paths of interest and discovery led me to where I am now.",
      "Over the course of my career, I've worked with and founded several tech startups across supercomputing and music-technology, in technical and commercial roles, and as individual contributor and manager."
