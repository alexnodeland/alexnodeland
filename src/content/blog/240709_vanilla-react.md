Vanilla ReAct is a minimalist Python framework that implements a Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) agent using the OpenAI API. The framework provides a clean, simple interface for building AI agents that can reason about problems and take actions to solve them.

Built without complex conversational AI frameworks, Vanilla ReAct focuses on the core ReAct pattern, making it perfect for educational purposes and rapid prototyping of agent-based systems.
