In my free time, I like to learn about a range of technologies across generative AI, creative computing, human-computer interaction, synthesizers, home automation, and hydroponics. I have a handful of personal projects that I'm working on and would like to release over time.

## Current Focus Areas

- **Generative AI**: Exploring creative applications of machine learning models
- **Creative Computing**: Building tools that bridge technology and art
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Designing intuitive interfaces for complex systems
- **Synthesizers**: Digital audio processing and synthesis techniques
- **Home Automation**: Smart home integration and IoT projects
- **Hydroponics**: Automated growing systems and environmental monitoring

These projects allow me to experiment with new technologies and approaches that I might not encounter in my professional work, keeping my skills sharp and my curiosity alive.
