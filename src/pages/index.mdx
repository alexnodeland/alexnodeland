        Hi, I'm Alex, a freelance technical consultant with a background in distributed computing and creative technology.

    <section className="about">
      <div className="about-content">
        <p>
          I've always had an innate interest in technology. I remember building my first "guitar pedal" when I was around 10 years old, 
          it was a rudimentary talk box (literally held together with duct tape), but it worked! That first experience with creative 
          technology sparked my interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          My subsequent deep dive into music technology lasted throughout my youth and university years, and ultimately lead me to the 
          space of computational mathematics and distributed computing, specifically distributed-memory HPC. Also, having been exposed 
          to startups at a very early age, joining one as my first job at 15 years old, I learned the importance of building scalable 
          technical strategy, from processes to product. These paths of interest and discovery led me to where I am now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course of my career, I've worked with and founded several tech startups across supercomputing and music-technology, 
          in technical and commercial roles, and as individual contributor and manager.

      <h2>Technical Consulting</h2>
      <p>
        As a technical strategy consultant, I aim to bring my wide-ranging experience to early stage startups who are looking to build 
        scalable and efficient processes that don't get in the way and provide immediate value.

      <p>
        In my free time, I like to learn about a range of technologies across generative AI, creative computing, human-computer 
        interaction, synthesizers, home automation, and hydroponics. I have a handful of personal projects that I'm working on and 
        would like to release over time.
