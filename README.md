### Hi there 👋

I'm Alex.

With a diverse background, in arts, mathematics, engineering, and start-up development, I turn ideas into usable and applicable solutions, and propel them to the market effectively, and scalably.

👨‍💻 - As an engineer, I excel at and enjoy analyzing and modeling systems and/or processes. 

🧙‍♂️ - As a mathematician, I constantly search for rules which govern systems. 

👨‍🎨 - As an artist, I share insights and solutions creatively and effectively. 


I combine these aspects of my background to convey complex ideas simply. These approaches allow me to effectively bring products to market and create understandable solutions to complex problems.

- mathematics and scientific computing
- devops and processes
- human computer interaction
- home automation
- synthesizers
