### Hi there 👋

I'm Alex.

I bring together engineering, mathematics, and the arts to turn ideas into scalable, creative, and practical solutions.  
I love analyzing systems, uncovering their governing rules, and sharing insights in ways that spark clarity.

👨‍💻 Engineer — modeling systems and building scalable software  
🧙‍♂️ Mathematician — exploring the rules that govern complexity  
🎨 Artist — communicating ideas simply and creatively

🔭 Currently exploring:  
- Language models, categories, and graphs  
- Human-computer interaction and automation  
- Synthesizers and sound design
