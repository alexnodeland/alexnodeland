### Hi there 👋

I'm Alex.

With a diverse background, in arts, mathematics, engineering, and start-up development, I turn ideas into usable and applicable solutions, and propel them to the market effectively, and scalably.

👨‍💻 - As an engineer, I excel at and enjoy analyzing and modeling systems and/or processes. 

🧙‍♂️ - As a mathematician, I constantly search for rules which govern systems. 

👨‍🎨 - As an artist, I share insights and solutions creatively and effectively. 


I combine these aspects of my background to convey complex ideas simply. These approaches allow me to effectively bring products to market and create understandable solutions to complex problems.

My interests include:
- mathematics and scientific computing
- devops and processes
- human computer interaction
- home automation
- synthesizers
